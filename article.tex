Have you ever heard of the \texttt{git bundle} command? I hadn't. It
bundles a set of Git objects---potentially even an entire
repository---into a single file. Git allows you to treat that file as
if it were a standard Git database, so you can do things like clone a
repo directly from it. Its purpose is to easily sneakernet pushes or
even whole repositories across air gaps.
